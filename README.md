* I create an SQL database to store the data, run queries, and extract necessary information for visualization using SQL (MySQL Workbench)
* Using Python, I connect to the SQL database, and leverage libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. to clean and visualize the data. I also execute relevant SQL queries and save the separate csv files for further visualiztion in Tableau.
